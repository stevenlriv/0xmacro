# Design Exercise

Well said, you touched on most of the key points to consider when deciding the threshold on a multisig:

* Risk of an honest owner losing their keys
* Risk of a malicious owner signing a malicious transaction
* Speed of Transaction Signing

But consider in the N-of-N case, the possibility of a malicious user holding the multisig's assets hostage, and refusing to sign a transaction unless the other owners agree to sign a transaction that the malicious owner wants.

N-of-N is for that reason, and the reasons you mentioned, almost always a terrible idea.
